# DAT250 Expass 6

## Technical issues
- I encountered an issue with using rabbitmq when compiling files according to the tutorials and when working with gradle, which hindered me from running the experiment files. It appeared to be due to not installing rabbitmq properly through Docker, thus I chose to install it through chocolatey on Windows without facing the same issue.

## Code
- <b>Installation:</b> <a href=https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-windows>RabbitMQ on Windows</a> (I have no related code to the installation, but I followed the <b>Using chocolatey</b> section from this source).
- <b>Hello World:</b> https://github.com/Mantonio02/MyRepo/tree/main/expass6/src/main/java/org/example1.
- <b>Work Queues:</b> https://github.com/Mantonio02/MyRepo/tree/main/expass6/src/main/java/org/example2.

## Pending issues
- Although I solved the installation, I was still not able to compile the files according to the tutorials. However, I managed to run the files anyway through the mentioned method from the 2nd experiment of this assigment.
- I made an entirely new project for this assignment through the IDE I used (IntelliJ), and have not merged it properly with this repository. The folder <a href=https://github.com/Mantonio02/MyRepo/tree/main/expass6>expass6</a> and all of its content are a part of that project.
