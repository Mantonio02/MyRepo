# DAT250 Expass 6

## Technical issues
- I encountered an issue with using rabbitmq when compiling files according to the tutorials and when working with gradle, which hindered me from running the experiment files. It appeared to be due to not installing rabbitmq properly through Docker, thus I chose to install it through chocolatey without facing the same issue.

## Code
- Installation:
- Hello World:
- Work Queues:
- Topics:

## Pending issues
- Although I solved the installation, I was still not able to compile the files according to the tutorials. However, I managed to run the files anyway through the mentioned method from the 2nd experiment of this assigment.
- Have not merged the assignment files to this repository, they are kept in another (accessible through the links above).
