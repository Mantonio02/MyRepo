### DAT250 Expass 5

## Technical issues
- I encountered an issue related to receiving False first as a result from package validation, although it was due to package version differences. Fixed it by changing the expected version.
- I encountered an issue with the usage of mapReduce on a database with mongosh. Found out it was due to using the local database, which I was not supposed to do for mapReduce.

## Installation Package Validation
- Note: I installed two different packages, the former being v.8.0.0 and the latter v.7.4.1.
