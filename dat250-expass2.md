DAT250 Expass2

On this assignment I have done the following:
- Step 0: Downloaded Bruno as preferred HTTP client.
- Step 1: Skipped because I already made the repository back in previous assignment.
- Step 2: Implemented Java Beans for all the class diagrams User, Poll, Vote and VoteOption, and the mentioned manager classes PollManager and DomainManager.
- Step 3: Made a test scenario like the one mentioned in expass2.md on Bruno.
- Step 4: Began implementing controllers. With the exception of UserController, I have so far only made what could be referred as skeleton code for the others.
- Step 5: Have not done it.
- Step 6: - - || - -
- Step 7: - - || - -

Technical Installation Issues:
- On this assignment I encountered no particular technical issues with downloading software.
From what I can gather from expass 1, I followed the suggested tutorials that were provided, and in cases where I received errors during installation, I tried to resolve it by taking a look at the error messages that would occur. If I could not fix it, Google had an answer in most cases.

Pending Issues:
- I did not manage to complete step 4 and beyond, a lot of time went into trying to understand the concepts of this assignment whenever things went wrong.
